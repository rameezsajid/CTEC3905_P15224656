### My Project

- I have used **HTML** to structure the web page
- And I have used **CSS** to style the page
- Some **JAVASCRIPT** has been used to help my webpage have a smooth scroll and to display the first navigation bar
- My webpage has only one page and the navigtion bars when clicked on will scroll to the appropriate section
- The page also has buttons when clicked will scroll down to particular **sections**
- The page is responsive and the layout is mobile first and will change when screen size is increased
- I have added descriptive comments throughout the code
- In the footer there is a link that sends the user to my GitHub folder for this project
- There are some wireframes in the **wireframe folder** that shows how the layout will be in different screen sizes
- I have also added a test log document and the image of the test log in the **test-log folder**
- The HTML and CSS is fully validated and there are no errors
